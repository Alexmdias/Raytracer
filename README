Compiling and Running on *nix
=============================

The provided Makefile will compile on a number of Linux/Unix
base systems. 

    make

To run the executable:

    ./raytracer

By default, this will render a scene with only a red cube and save the 
resulting image as output.bmp.

To run the executable and render a different scene, pass it as the first
argument:

    ./raytracer your_scene_file_path


Scene Format
============

See scenes/basic.ray for a self-describing scene file.
